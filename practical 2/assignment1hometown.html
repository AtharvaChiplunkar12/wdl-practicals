            <dd>-Gateway of India, the best place to visit in Mumbai, was built in 1924 by George Willet to honor the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. Visit this place in the early morning or late evening hours to enjoy the cool breeze of the sea with your family sans the crowd. Located next to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and facing the vast Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India leaves you spellbound in every way possible. Take a ferry ride offered here to experience a stupendous view of this monument right from the sea and you can also visit other main attractions nearby.</dd>

            <dd>-Sprawling over an area of 104 sq. km. of land, this is one of the most-visited national parks in Asia and because of this, I give it the 2nd spot among all the best places to visit in Mumbai. With all sorts of fun activities, this park can surely be a family entertainer. You can watch the big cats of the park close enough in a safari cage and have a fun day boating in the artificial lake in the park. Take the forest road or stairs and hike towards the Gandhi Tekdi, a memorial built in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. The toy train, Van Rani, is another popular attraction here, especially among kids. You can also visit the 2000-years-old Kanheri Caves to capture the Buddha relics. The undisturbed natural trails and the Jain Temple in the forest are also sure to make your visit a memorable one.</dd>

            <dd>-How about taking a trip with your family to one of the most popular religious place in Mumbai, Yes, we are talking about Siddhivinayak Temple. The temple has a small mandap with the shrine for Siddhi Vinayak ("Ganesha who grants your wish"). The wooden doors to the sanctum are carved with images of the Ashtavinayak (the eight manifestations of Ganesha in Maharashtra). The inner roof of the sanctum is plated with gold, and the central statue is of Ganesha. In the periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. The exterior of the temple consists of a dome which is lit up with multiple colors in the evenings and they keep changing every few hours. The statue of Shri Ganesha is located exactly under the dome.</dd>
